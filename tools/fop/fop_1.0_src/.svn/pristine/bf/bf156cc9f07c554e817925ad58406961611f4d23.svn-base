/**
 * A helper class to read structured fields from a MO:DCA document. Each
 * component of a mixed object document is explicitly defined and delimited
 * in the data. This is accomplished through the use of MO:DCA data structures,
 * called structured fields. Structured fields are used to envelop document
 * components and to provide commands and information to applications using
 * the data. Structured fields may contain one or more parameters. Each
 * parameter provides one value from a set of values defined by the architecture.
 * <p/>
 * MO:DCA structured fields consist of two parts: an introducer that identifies
 * the length and type of the structured field, and data that provides the
 * structured field's effect. The data is contained in a set of parameters,
 * which can consist of other data structures and data elements. The maximum
 * length of a structured field is 32767 bytes.
 * <p/>
