  <title tab-width="80">What is Apache FOP?</title>
  <p>
    Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is the most popular XSL-FO implementation. 
    It is used to create documents in PDF, PostScript and other formats.
  </p>
  <p>
    XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a W3C standard which consists of two parts:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>XSL Transformations (XSLT)</li>
    <li>XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Apache FOP currently supports a large subset of XSL-FO&#160;1.0 and some of the new features
    to be introduced with XSL-FO&#160;1.1. Details on the compliance levels can be found on the FOP
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    The software is written in Java and published under a liberal license, the 
    Apache License version&#160;2.0, which allows commercial use and redistribution. 
    For details, please read the license text and the license FAQ on the ASF website.
