    <p>
      A second "beta" grade release of the new FOP codebase with a modified and
      now considered stable API. The release contains many bug fixes as well as
      new features mainly related to even more extensive support of the XSL-FO
      specification. This is expected to be the last "beta" release before we
      go to a 1.0 release!

      The Apache FOP team is proud to present to you the largely rewritten 
      codebase which is finally in a state where you can start to use it.

      The Apache Board of Directors agreed to the creation of the 
      <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org">Apache XML Graphics</a>
      project which will be comprised of Batik and FOP. Both former 
      Apache XML subprojects are in this way complying with the Board's desire
      to improve project oversight. Both project teams also see additional
      benefits of working more closely together.
