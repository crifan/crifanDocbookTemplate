# CatalogManager.properties for Catalog Entity Resolver.
#
# This is the default properties file for your project.
# This facilitates local configuration of application-specific catalogs.
# If you have defined any local catalogs, then they will be loaded
# before Forrest's core catalogs.
#
# See the Apache Forrest documentation:
# http://forrest.apache.org/docs/your-project.html
# http://forrest.apache.org/docs/validation.html

# verbosity:
# The level of messages for status/debug (messages go to standard output).
# The setting here is for your own local catalogs.
# The verbosity of Forrest's core catalogs is controlled via
#  forrestcore/src/core/context/WEB-INF/cocoon.xconf
#
# The following messages are provided ...
#  0 = none
#  1 = ? (... not sure yet)
#  2 = 1+, Loading catalog, Resolved public, Resolved system
#  3 = 2+, Catalog does not exist, resolvePublic, resolveSystem
#  10 = 3+, List all catalog entries when loading a catalog
#    (Cocoon also logs the "Resolved public" messages.)
